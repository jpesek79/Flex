		<h2>Professional Background</h2>
		<p>I spent a while as a Chef, in Seattle, Washington, then moved back to St. Louis and continued working in a variety of kitchens. After deciding not to make a career as a chef, I enlisted in the Army. I served four years in the IT field and was recieved an Honorable Discharge. I spent time doing contracting work for the Department of Defense in Virginia before deciding to pursue a degree in Computer Programming.</p><br>

		<p>My name is Joseph Pesek, and I am originally from Nebraska, although I was raised mostly in Missouri. After graduating from Eckerd College in St. Petersburg with a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy, I spent some time in Florida before before moving back to St. Louis, Missouri. I soon began a backpacking trip around the country for 3 months and ended up in Seattle, Washington, where I lived for a year.</p><br>

		<h2>Future Professional Goals</h2>
		<p>After graduating this time, I look forward to a long career in my new field of study, working as a computer programmer. My ideal prospects would involve working with the Department of Defense again creating software and applications that can be used to help protect the nation and the lives of my friends still serving in the Armed Forces.</p>
